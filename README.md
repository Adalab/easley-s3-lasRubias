#  React Card Creator Las Rubias

The projects go from the Card Creator JS version from Undefined team to a refactorizing  React web.

##  Steps in the project

We inherit the JavaScript code from Undefined team. They did a  responsive web to generate personal cards and share them via Twitter using vanilla JS. 
The first step to us was understood the inherit code and then refactorized it. For that purpose, we study the code, understand the functions so we could refactorize it after. 
We include some improvements, logic to correct bugs and comments. 

After that, we introduce React in the project, creating a react app and adding functions and components step by step. We support in the inherent code, especially the HTML and SASS.


#  Las Rubias

This team was created in the third Sprint in Adalab Easley promotion. 
The components are Maria Badanina, Stepahnie Guevara, Desirée García and Joana Jiménez. 
We work as a team based on agile management with daily, trello communication, pair programming, pull request and self-organization to execute the project.
